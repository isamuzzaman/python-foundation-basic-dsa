# Day 2: Conditions & Loops (Python)

## Topics Learned
- **Conditional Statements:** if / elif / else
  - Positive / Negative / Zero check
  - Even / Odd check
- **Loops:**
  - `for` loop → fixed number of iterations
  - `while` loop → condition-based iterations
- **Combining Loops + Conditions**
  - Example: Sum of even numbers from 1 to N
- **Mini Project-2: Number Utility Tool**
  - Check Even/Odd
  - Check Positive/Negative/Zero
  - Print multiplication table (1 to 10)

## Sample Output

Enter a number: 5
Even/Odd        : Odd
Number Type     : Positive

Multiplication Table:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50


## Skills Gained
- Decision making using conditions
- Repetition using loops
- Combining loops and conditions
- Clean, readable program output
- Thinking for small real-life utility programs
