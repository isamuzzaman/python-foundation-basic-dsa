# Day 17: Big O Notation & Arrays

## Description
Learned the basics of time complexity and array operations to build a strong foundation in Data Structures.

## Summary
- Understood **Big O Notation** (O(1), O(n), O(n²))
- Worked with arrays using Python lists
- Practiced array traversal techniques
- Implemented **linear search**
- Built a mini project to analyze student marks

## Mini Project
**Student Marks Analyzer**  
Calculates total, average, highest, and lowest marks from an array.

## Skills Gained
- Time complexity awareness
- Array-based problem solving
- DSA fundamentals
