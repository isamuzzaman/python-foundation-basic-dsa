# Day 15: Debugging, Docstrings & Code Optimization

## Description
Learned how to write cleaner, safer, and self-explaining Python code while handling common errors.

## Summary
- Identified common Python errors: SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, IndexError
- Practiced debugging using `print()` statements
- Learned **docstrings** to describe functions
- Improved code quality with clean & optimized functions
- Built a mini project: Error-Safe Calculator

## Mini Project
**Error-Safe Calculator**  
Handles invalid input and prevents runtime crashes using try-except and docstrings.

## Skills Gained
- Debugging techniques
- Writing self-explanatory code
- Error handling & safe programming
