# Day 3: Functions (Python)

## Description
This day focuses on learning Python functions to write clean, reusable, and modular code.

## Summary
- Defined and called functions
- Used parameters and return values
- Created functions for logic (Even/Odd, Average)

## Sample Output
The number is: Even
Average number: 20.0

Add: 6
Subtract: -2
Multiplication: 8
Divide: 0.5
## Skills Gained
- Code reusability
- Breaking large problems into small functions
- Writing clean and structured Python programs
