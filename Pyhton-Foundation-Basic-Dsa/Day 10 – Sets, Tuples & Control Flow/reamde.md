## Day 10 – Sets, Tuples & Control Flow

### What I Learned Today
- Learned about **set** and how it automatically removes duplicate values
- Used set operations like **union**, **intersection**, and **difference**
- Learned **tuple** and tuple unpacking
- Understood the difference between **break** and **continue**
- Learned the use of the **pass** keyword
- Practiced applying control flow in real programs

### Mini Project
**Unique Student Registration System**
- Added student names using set
- Automatically removed duplicate entries
- Displayed all unique registered students using loop

### Key Concepts Practiced
- Set
- Tuple
- Loop control (break, continue)
